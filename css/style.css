/* this file imports all your scss partials to be compiled in one
stylesheet, which you can attach to your html. 

All the files that are prefixed with an underscore are called
partials eg "_name-of-file.scss" meaning that their css isn't compiled

colours, font-stacks, or any css value you think you might want
to reuse. 

SASS uses the '$' symbol to declare variables.*/
